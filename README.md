## 1: Think About How You Are Gonna Build Your City
You can always go for the blocky-style residentials which is good in the early game where you are trying to unlock everything and get money, But i would advise you to build more expensive and more beautiful roads and think how you are gonna build your city before actually building it

## 2: Use Public Transport 
the best way to reduce traffic or completely erradicate it in the game - its extremely good to build multiple transport options instead of one, why? because multiple options stops citizens from using their car or walking. for example an underground metro station next to a tram or bus stop.

## 3: Lane Mathematics
By far the best option of fixing traffic pile-up. if you look closely you can see that the road to the right has one way straight into the highway whilst the other lanes on the road before it have their own lane. what you need to do is to make the road behind / in front the entrance of a 1 way road a two way (depending on the size of your road, Look at the left top side of the screenshot) so they are assigned their own dedicated lane instead of heading straight on the lane that is coming through

## 4: Walking paths
Walking paths are extremely versatile when used correctly. Your citizens love walking, And by using pathways it will reduce the traffic in your city greatly. Here is a demonstration of how i have done it.

## 5: Building multiple cities
By far the least done option, It is good to build smaller cities, But over time, you will run out of space to build (around 100k - 150k) and it will facilitate traffic off your main city.
